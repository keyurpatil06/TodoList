The TodoList app is a simple yet effective tool for managing your tasks and todos. It allows you to add, edit, delete, and mark todos as completed. One of the key features of this app is that it stores your todos in the browser's local storage, ensuring that your todos remain intact even if you reload the page or reopen the browser.
